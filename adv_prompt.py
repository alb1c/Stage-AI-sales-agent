#import BERTSimilarity.BERTSimilarity as bertsimilarity


'''
This is a sample example of checking similarity between 2 sentences.
This takes as inputs 2 sentences (strings).
The BERTSimilarity() class is instantiated and then the calculate_distance() method
is called, which computes the distance (cosine).
